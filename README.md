# Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord Community Patch module
This is going to be a mod that just fixes up some things in Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord before the Devs &amp; QA team can get to them. They have priorities and a process.

## Building

This repo should be placed in the folder `Modules\CommunityPatch` under your Bannerlord installation, and it will build out-of-the-box. Just open the \*.sln in an applicable IDE (JetBrains Rider, Visual Studio, etc) and build normally.

The default location for Bannerlord is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord`.

If your Bannerlord or local repo are in a different place, you can change the property MnB2BannerlordDir in Directory.Build.props to your bannerlord install. When editing the file be sure to use `&amp;` in place of an `&` if the path has one. If you do move the repo, then installing the mod will require copying it to `Modules\CommunityPatch`. Take care that the folder name is correct else problems may occur.
