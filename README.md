# Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord Community Patch module
This is going to be a mod that just fixes up some things in Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord before the Devs &amp; QA team can get to them. They have priorities and a process.

If you'd like to collaborate on the project, please contact me via discord (̑[🅠#4344](https://discordapp.com/users/475636674076868618)) on the [TW Forums - Modding](https://discord.gg/5fBVT8j) discord or the [Mount and Blade](https://discordapp.com/invite/mountandblade) discord.

Current Fixes:
* The Disciplinarian perk.
* The Healthy Scout perk.
* The Peak Form perk.
* The Ruler perk.
* The Reeve perk.
* The Bannerlord perk.
* Fixes Item Comparison perk-based coloring.

Current Features:
* Enable and Disable the Intro Video
* Copy Diagnostic Info to the Clipboard
* Toggle recording First Chance Exception info (don't use unless troubleshooting bugs)
* Automatically capture Diagnostic Info to the Clipboard when an Unhandled Exception crash occurs

Mods can add a <DelayedSubModule> element containing traditional <SubModules> that will be only loaded after the first tick of the game. This also allows delay loaded mods to refer to other modules' assemblies, such as SandBox's SandBox.ViewModelCollection.dll etc.
