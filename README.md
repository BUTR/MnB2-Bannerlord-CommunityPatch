## Building

This repo should be placed under the Modules folder in your Bannerlord installation, and it will build out-of-the-box. Just open the \*.sln in Visual Studio and build normally.

The default location for Bannerlord is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord`.

If your Bannerlord or local repo are in a different place, you can change the property MnB2BannerlordDir in Directory.Build.props to your bannerlord install. When editing the file be sure to use `&amp;` in place of an `&` if the path has one.
