# Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord Community Patch module
This is going to be a mod that just fixes up some things in Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord before the Devs &amp; QA team can get to them. They have priorities and a process.

### Current Fixes

  * Leadership
    * Disciplinarian <sub><sup>Fixed in e1.0.6</sup></sub>
  * Scouting
    * Healthy Scout
  * Steward
    * Agrarian

    * Bannerlord
    * Man-At-Arms
    * Nourish Settlement
    * Prominence
    * Prosperous Reign
    * Reeve
    * Ruler
    * Supreme Authority
    * Swords As Tribute
    * Tax Collector
* Learning Rate explanation
* Item Comparison perk-based coloring
* Tier 5 Prisoners not being able to be recruited <sub><sup>Tier 6 are not able to be recruited by intended design</sup></sub>
* Party Morale bonus being too low for >10 food variety

### Current Features
* Enable and Disable the Intro Video
* Copy Diagnostic Info to the Clipboard
* Toggle recording First Chance Exception info (don't use unless troubleshooting bugs)
* Automatically capture Diagnostic Info to the Clipboard when an Unhandled Exception crash occurs


### Modders
Mods can add a <DelayedSubModule> element containing traditional <SubModules> that will be only loaded after the first tick of the game. This also allows delay loaded mods to refer to other modules' assemblies, such as SandBox's SandBox.ViewModelCollection.dll etc.
